_[company-mode][company] completion for Swift projects via SourceKit with the help of [SourceKittenDaemon][sourcekittendaemon]._

## Limitations

* Only works when there is a `*.xcodeproj` up the directory tree.
* OSX-only, since this communicates with SourceKit which only runs on OSX (AFAIK)
* You need to have `curl` on your machine

## Installation

First install [SourceKittenDaemon][sourcekittendaemon]. Make sure that it's in
the `exec-path` of your Emacs.

And then you can install `company-sourcekit` in the following ways:

### MELPA

```sh
M-x package-install <RET> company-sourcekit <RET>
```

### Source

Make sure this repository is in your `load-path`, and then:

```elisp
(require 'company-sourcekit)
(add-to-list 'company-backends 'company-sourcekit)
```

## Configuration

### Automatically turn on completions

Completions will not be loaded automatically in `Swift` mode. To enable them, add the following to your emacs init file *(use `SPC-f-e-i` to open it in spacemacs)*:
```elisp
  (add-hook 'swift-mode-hook (lambda ()
                              (set (make-local-variable 'company-backends) '(company-sourcekit))
                              (company-mode)))
```

### Options

* _`company-sourcekit-use-yasnippet`_ - Use yasnippet for completion expansion. By default this is enabled if yasnippet is detected.
* _`company-sourcekit-verbose`_ - Log company-related messages to `*messages*` with verbosity
* _`sourcekit-available-ports`_ - A list of ports that `sourcekittendaemon` is allowed to listen on.
* _`sourcekit-sourcekittendaemon-executable`_ - Location of the `sourcekittendaemon` executable
* _`sourcekit-curl-executable`_ - Location of the `curl` executable
* _`sourcekit-verbose`_ - Log sourcekittendaemon-related messages to `*messages*` with verbosity

## How it works

* company-sourcekit communicates with sourcekittendaemon via HTTP.
* Which in turn communicates with SourceKit using the [sourcekitten][sourcekitten] framework.
* sourcekittendaemon will read your `.xcodeproj` file and determine the best configuration options to pass to sourcekit.
